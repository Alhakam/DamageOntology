<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
<span>The Damage Topology Ontology (DOT) allows the definition of damage representations and their relations with other damages and affected construction components.
The ontology supports a generic damage modeling approach and therefore could be applied for any type of degradation as well as for any construction type (e.g. buildings or bridges). Damage representations can be modeled either as damaged areas (<a href="#DamageArea">dot:DamageArea</a>) or elementary damages / damage elements (<a href="#DamageElement">dot:DamageElement</a>). Thereby, instances of <a href="#DamageElement">dot:DamageElement</a> should be aggregated in a <a href="#DamageArea">dot:DamageArea</a>, however significant damages e.g. large cracks could be modelled as <a href="#DamageElement">dot:DamageElement</a> without <a href="#DamageArea">dot:DamageArea</a>. For grouping multiple coherent damages, a damage pattern could be defined by using <a href="#DamagePattern">dot:DamagePattern</a> as third type for damage representation.
In addition to the topology, damage relevant documentation that is commonly created during inspections and damage assessment could be put in relation to the damages as well as to the damaged components.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for DOT terms is http://www.w3id.org/dot#</p>
<p align="center">The suggested prefix for the DOT namespace is dot</p><br>
The ontology contains no taxonomic elements or other classes for damage causation, national standards, mechanics, etc. besides the topology and documentation. However, DOT would work as a core ontology on which additional ontologies for specific use cases could be added as extensions.</span>
