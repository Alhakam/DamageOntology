# DOT - Damage Topology Ontology

The Damage Topology Ontology (DOT) allows the definition of damage representations and their relations with other damages and affected construction components.

The ontology supports a generic damage modeling approach and therefore could be applied for any type of degradation as well as for any construction type (e.g. buildings or bridges). Damage representations can be modeled either as damaged areas or individual damage elements. For grouping multiple adjacent damages a damage pattern could be defined.

The ontology contains no taxonomic elements or other classes for damage causation, national standards, mechanics, etc. besides the topology and documentation. However, DOT would work as a core ontology on which additional ontologies for specific use cases could be added as extensions. Three example extension ontologies can be found in ´[dot/Extension](https://github.com/Alhakam/dot/tree/master/Extension)´.
